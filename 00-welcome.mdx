    Hello 👋 I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/agbacoder">Korede Bashir</a> and welcome to this Intro to Node js course!
    I'm a Technical Writer at NimbleEdge, where I work on the EnvisEdge library documentation. I've been
    teaching courses and giving talks on JS since 2019. It's my secret to learning
    faster.

Do you know how to build sites and apps
in the browser with JS? Or maybe you have experience with a language like Python, PHP, or Ruby.
Regardless, this is the course for anyone who wants to get started with Node fast.
Some things we'll be covering in this course include:

* 😱 Node vs Web
* 👀 Modules
* 🔥 File System 
* 🎉 CLI's
* 💰 NPM
* 💸 Servers
* ☁️deployment
* ... SO.MUCH.MORE


## Course
There's so much to learn when it comes to Node js. So the approach we're going to take in this
course is to build an example or two of some of the best use cases of Node js.
Think of it as building mini apps for each topic.
